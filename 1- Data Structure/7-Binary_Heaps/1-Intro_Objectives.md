[1] OBJECTIVES ::

    - Define what a binary heap is

    - Compare and contrast min and max heaps

    - Implement basic methods on heaps

    - Understand where heaps are used in the real world and what other data structures can be constructed from heaps 


[2] WHAT IS A BINARY HEAP?

    -> Very similar to a binary search tree, but with some different rules!

    -> In a MaxBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always larger than child nodes. In a MinBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes.


[3] MAX BINARY HEAP :

    => Each parent has at most two child nodes
    
    => The value of each parent node is always greater than its child nodes
    
    => In a max Binary Heap the parent is greater than the children, but there are no guarantees between sibling nodes.
    
    => A binary heap is as compact as possible. All the children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first
    
    $$ Value of parent is always greater than children $$
    $$ No Implied Ordering Between Siblings $$



[4] Why do we need to know this? 

    Binary Heaps are used to implement Priority Queues, which are very commonly used data structures

    They are also used quite a bit, with graph traversal algorithms

    We'll come back to this!

# // ----------------------------------------------- //

[5] THERE'S AN EASY WAY OF STORING A BINARY HEAP...

                    A LIST/ARRAY


    => For any index of an array n...

    => The left child is stored at 2n + 1

    => The right child is at 2n + 2


[6] WHAT IF WE HAVE A CHILD NODE AND WANT TO FIND ITS PARENT? 

    => For any child node at index  n...

    => Its parent is at index (n-1)/2


[7] DEFINING OUR CLASS
    
    => Class Name:

            MaxBinaryHeap

    => Properties:

            values = []

# // ------------------------------------------ //

[8] Adding to a MaxBinaryHeap :

    => Add to the end
    => Bubble up

$$ INSERT PSEUDOCODE $$
    
    1- Push the value into the values property on the heap
    2- Bubble the value up to its correct spot!

    ----  INSERT PSEUDOCODE  ----

        => Push the value into the values property on the heap
        
        => Bubble Up:
                -> Create a variable called index which is the length of the values property - 1
                
                -> Create a variable called parentIndex which is the floor of (index-1)/2
                
                -> Keep looping as long as the values element at the parentIndex is less than the values element at the child index
                        
                        >> Swap the value of the values element at the parentIndex with the value of the element property at the child index
                        
                        >> Set the index to be the parentIndex, and start over!

$$ The Code $$

    class MaxBinaryHeap {
        constructor() {
            this.values = [41, 39, 33, 18, 27, 12];
        }

        insert(element) {
            this.values.push(element);
            this.bubbleUp();
        };

        bubbleUp() {
            let index = this.values.length - 1;
            let element = this.values[index];

            while(index > 0) {
                let parentIndex = Math.floor((index - 1) / 2);
                let parent = this.values[parentIndex];

                if (element <= parent) break;

                this.values[parentIndex] = element;
                this.values[index] = parent;
                index = parentIndex;
            }
        }

    };

    const heap = new MaxBinaryHeap();

[9] REMOVING FROM A HEAP :

    => Remove the root
    
    => Replace with the most recently added
    
    => Adjust (sink down)


    ---->   SINK DOWN?    <-----
        The procedure for deleting the root from the heap (effectively extracting the maximum element in a max-heap or the minimum element in a min-heap) and restoring the properties is called down-heap (also known as bubble-down, percolate-down, sift-down, trickle down, heapify-down, cascade-down, and extract-min/max).


        -----   REMOVING PSEUDOCODE    -----
            =>Swap the first value in the values property with the last one
            
            => Pop from the values property, so you can return the value at the end.
            
            => Have the new root "sink down" to the correct spot...â€‹
                    >> Your parent index starts at 0 (the root)
                    
                    >> Find the index of the left child: 2 * index + 1 (make sure its not out of bounds)
                    
                    >> Find the index of the right child: 2*index + 2 (make sure its not out of bounds)
                    
                    >> If the left or right child is greater than the element...swap. If both left and right children are larger, swap with the largest child.
                    
                    >> The child index you swapped to now becomes the new parent index.  
                    
                    >> Keep looping and swapping until neither child is larger than the element.
                    
                    >>Return the old root!
                            (also called extractMax)

$$ The Code  $$

        extractMax() {
                const max = this.values[0];
                const end = this.values.pop();
                if (this.values.length > 0) {
                    this.values[0] = end;
                    this.sinkDown();
                }
                return max;
        }

        sinkDown() {
            let idx = 0;
            const length = this.values.length;
            const element = this.values[0];

            while(true) {
                let leftChildIdx = 2 * idx + 1;
                let rightChildIdx = 2 * idx + 2;

                let leftChild, rightChild;
                let swap = null;

                if (leftChildIdx < length) {
                    leftChild = this.values[leftChildIdx];
                    if (leftChild > element) {
                        swap = leftChildIdx;
                    }
                }

                if (rightChildIdx < length) {
                    rightChild = this.values[rightChildIdx];
                    if (
                        (swap === null && rightChild > element) ||
                        (swap !== null && rightChild > leftChild)
                    ) {
                        swap = rightChildIdx;
                    }
                }

                if (swap === null) break;

                this.values[idx] = this.values[swap];
                this.values[swap] = element;
                idx = swap;
            }
        }

[10] BUILDING APRIORITY QUEUE :: WHAT IS A PRIORITY QUEUE?

        => A data structure where each element has a priority. Elements with higher priorities are served before elements with lower priorities.

        => A NAIVE VERSION ::

            Use a list to store all elements
            Iterate over the entire thing to find the highest priority element.

    $$ OUR PRIORITY QUEUE $$

        -> Write a Min Binary Heap - lower number means higher priority.
        
        -> Each Node has a val and a priority.  Use the priority to build the heap.
        
        -> Enqueue method accepts a value and priority, makes a new node, and puts it in the right spot based off of its priority.
        
        -> Dequeue method removes root element, returns it, and rearranges heap using priority.


    $$ MaxHeapify $$    Converting an array into a MaxBinaryHeap

        -> Create a new heap
        
        -> Iterate over the array and invoke your insert function
        
        -> return the values property on the heap


    $$ Heapsort $$
            We can sort an array in O(n log n) time and O(1) space by making it a heap!

            => Make the array a max heap (use maxHeapify)
            
            => Loop over the array, swap the root node with last item in the array
            
            => After swapping each item, run maxHeapify again to find the next root node
            
            => Next loop you'll swap the root node with the second-to-last item in the array and run maxHeapify again.
            
            => Once you've run out of items to swap, you have a sorted array! 

# // ------------------------------------------ //

[11] MinBinaryHeap ::

    Same idea, min values go upwards.









# // ------------------------------------------ //

[12] Big O of Binary Heaps :

        Insertion -   O(log N)

        Removal -   O(log N)

        Search -   O(N)






# // ------------------------------------------ //

[13] RECAP ::

    => Binary Heaps are very useful data structures for sorting, and implementing other data structures like priority queues

    => Binary Heaps are either MaxBinaryHeaps or MinBinaryHeaps with parents either being smaller or larger than their children

    => With just a little bit of math, we can represent heaps using arrays!
